# Images Directory

This directory is for storing local images for the pet adoption website.

Currently, the website uses external images from Unsplash for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you would replace these with your own images stored in this directory.

## Image Credits

All images used in this project are from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), a source for freely-usable images.

## Image Naming Convention

When adding your own images, please follow this naming convention:

- Pet images: `[animal-type][number].jpg` (e.g., `dog1.jpg`, `cat2.jpg`)
- Team photos: `team[number].jpg` (e.g., `team1.jpg`, `team2.jpg`)
- Testimonial photos: `testimonial[number].jpg` (e.g., `testimonial1.jpg`)
- General images: descriptive name (e.g., `about-hero.jpg`, `mission.jpg`)

## Image Optimization

Before adding images to this directory, please optimize them for web use:
- Resize to appropriate dimensions (max width 1200px for hero images, 600px for thumbnails)
- Compress to reduce file size
- Use JPG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency, or WebP for better compression
